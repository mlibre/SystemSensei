## How to Use üõ†Ô∏è

1. Download the script: `git clone https://github.com/mlibre/SystemSensei`

2. `cd SystemSensei`

3. Make it executable: `chmod +x systemsensei.sh`

4. Run it: `./systemsensei.sh`

5. Or `bash systemsensei.sh | less` to view output one page at a time

**Bonus Feature! üåê**

Now, you can use the `-n` option to focus specifically on network information:

```bash
./systemsensei.sh -n
```

That's it! Let SystemSensei.sh unveil the secrets of your Linux machine. ü•ã

## Using SystemSensei with Language Models ü§ñ

You can enhance the power of SystemSensei by feeding its output to Language Model APIs, such as GPT-3 or similar chatbots. Here's how:

1. Run **systemsensei.sh** to gather system information: `./systemsensei.sh > system_info.txt`

2. Use the generated `system_info.txt` file as input for your Language Model API of choice.

3. Ask the Language Model to diagnose system issues, answer questions, or perform any other tasks related to the gathered system information.

With this integration, you can turn your **SystemSensei** into a valuable tool for system diagnosis and assistance.
